# StudySpotApp-Frontend (localhost version)

Frontend for StudySpotApp, an app where people can find the availability of rooms and how crowded libraries are at their schools.
  There is also capability to add and edit their school if it has not been added already to the site
  
  In the final cloud based build, these static react files are optimized and served from a heroku server. The express backend is also hosted; a local version of the backend can be found under "StudySpotApp-Backend" in my repositories.
  
  Written with React
